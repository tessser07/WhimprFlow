# TRACK: Cleanup-LLM Runtime — Local Model + Claude API Toggle (WhimprFlow)

## 0. What we are actually cloning — Wispr Flow's cleanup layer (grounding for the whole design)

Primary sources on the real product's architecture (we re-implement from these facts; no code/assets copied):

- **Two-stage pipeline: ASR → LLM cleanup.** Wispr Flow runs "full transcription and LLM formatting/interpretation of speech within 700ms" after the user stops speaking, with an explicit latency budget: **ASR inference <200ms, LLM inference <200ms, network ≤200ms globally** (= ~600ms, target <700ms). OBSERVED (wisprflow.ai/post/technical-challenges).
- **Cleanup LLM = Llama family**, chosen because "Llama is controllable and customizable." Served on Baseten via TensorRT-LLM + a "Chains" multi-step framework. The LLM stage must generate **100+ tokens in <250ms**. They optimize **p90/p99, "don't care at all about p50."** End-to-end **<700ms at p99**. OBSERVED (baseten.co/resources/customers/wispr-flow, publ. 2026-03-24).
- **User-dictionary / auto-learned vocab = on-device RL policy**: captures user edits/corrections locally, decides when a correction should generalize, and aligns the LLM to the user's style. Note their own admission: "LLMs are phenomenal at recall, but very low precision" at applying personalized stylistic rules token-by-token — i.e. the dictionary is applied as *context to the cleanup LLM*, not as hard find-replace. OBSERVED.
- ASR is conditioned on speaker characteristics, surrounding app context, and user history. OBSERVED.
- The shipping product is **cloud-only** (subprocessors: Baseten, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cerebras, AWS), idles at ~800MB RAM / ~8% CPU. OBSERVED (multiple 2026 reviews). WhimprFlow's differentiator is **local-first by default** — so our cleanup layer must hit a similar budget without the cloud round-trip.

**Implication for our latency target (300–500ms p50 added cleanup latency):** Wispr's own LLM sub-budget is <200–250ms for ~100 tokens on dedicated GPU + TensorRT. On an M4 Pro that is only reachable for short outputs with a resident, quantized 3–4B model, streaming, and (optionally) speculative decoding. The 300–500ms figure is realistic for the LLM stage *on top of* ASR; a full 50-word (~67-token) cleanup end-to-end is ~600–900ms locally unless mitigated (see §7).

## 1. Local cleanup-model comparison (M4 Pro, 24 GB, macOS 15.7.3 Sequoia)

Text cleanup = punctuation/casing/filler-removal/light reformat + apply a user vocabulary. This is an **instruction-following + editing** task, not a reasoning task, so instruction-following (IFEval) and low latency matter far more than MMLU/MATH. Small dense models are ideal.

| Model | Params | Q4 size (GGUF/MLX) | IFEval | Other | License | Fit for cleanup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507** | 4B | ~2.4–2.6 GB (Q4_K_M) | **83.4** | MMLU-Pro 69.6, 256K ctx, BFCL-v3 61.9 | **Apache-2.0** | **Top pick.** Strong IF, tiny, permissive license, non-reasoning "Instruct" variant (no thinking overhead). OBSERVED (HF Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507) |
| **Gemma-3-4B-it (QAT q4_0)** | 4B | ~2.6 GB (int4 QAT) | **90.2** | GSM8K 89.2, strong multilingual (140+ langs) | Gemma license (custom, permissive-ish; AUP + naming clauses) | **Strong alt.** Highest IFEval; QAT keeps ~BF16 quality at int4 (perplexity drop cut 54% vs PTQ; within a few Elo of BF16). License less clean for bundling. OBSERVED (developers.googleblog QAT; llm-stats) |
| **Phi-4-mini-instruct** | 3.8B | ~2.5–3.0 GB (Q4_K_M) | (not published in sources) | MMLU ~73, ARC-C 83.7, GSM8K 88.6, HumanEval ~70 | **MIT** | Good, cleanest license; more reasoning-tilted than needed; slightly bigger. OBSERVED (localaimaster; NVIDIA modelcard) |
| **Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct** | 3B | ~2.0 GB (Q4_K_M) | ~"good" (below Qwen/Gemma) | weaker IF than the 4Bs | Llama 3.2 Community License (custom; <700M MAU OK; AUP) | Fastest/smallest; use if latency-critical and quality is acceptable. OBSERVED (llm-stats compare) |
| SmolLM3-3B | 3B | ~1.8 GB | — | fast | Apache-2.0 | Very fast (115 tok/s M4 Pro), viable budget option. OBSERVED (llmcheck) |

**Recommendation:** ship **Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 at Q4_K_M (GGUF) / 4-bit (MLX)** as the default local cleanup model — best balance of instruction-following, size (~2.5 GB), speed, and a clean Apache-2.0 license for bundling. Offer **Llama-3.2-3B** (or SmolLM3-3B) as a "faster/lower-quality" toggle for latency-sensitive users. Avoid reasoning variants (Phi-4-mini-**reasoning**, Qwen3 "thinking" mode) — thinking tokens blow the latency budget for a task that needs none.

**Quantization recommendation:** **Q4_K_M** (llama.cpp/GGUF) or **4-bit group-quant** (MLX) is the sweet spot — ~2–2.6 GB, negligible quality loss for editing tasks. For Gemma specifically prefer the **QAT q4_0** build (trained for int4). Do **not** go below 4-bit; Q8 (~4 GB) or FP16 (~8 GB) is unnecessary for cleanup and only costs RAM/latency. INFERRED (standard practice) + OBSERVED (Gemma QAT).

**License note for a bundled end-user app:** Apache-2.0 (Qwen3, SmolLM3) and MIT (Phi-4-mini) are cleanest to redistribute. Gemma and Llama both carry custom licenses with acceptable-use policies and naming/attribution clauses you must comply with when bundling — surmountable but adds legal review. This is a real selection criterion for "bundling," favoring Qwen3-4B.

## 2. Local throughput & time-to-first-token on M4-class hardware

Measured/aggregated numbers (Q4_K_M unless noted). Sources are Apple-Silicon benchmark aggregators (llmcheck.net, blogs) — treat as OBSERVED-secondary, ±20%.

**M4 Pro (24 GB) — directly on target hardware:**
- Qwen3-4B — **118 tok/s (MLX), TTFT ~0.3 s** OBSERVED (llmcheck)
- Phi-4-mini 3.8B — **108 tok/s (Ollama), TTFT ~0.4 s** OBSERVED
- SmolLM3-3B — **115 tok/s (Ollama), TTFT ~0.2 s** OBSERVED
- Mistral-7B — 98 tok/s (MLX), TTFT ~0.4 s OBSERVED (for scale)
- General: M4 Pro 24 GB runs 14B at 35–55 tok/s; 8B comfortably >70 tok/s; 3–4B >100 tok/s. OBSERVED.

**Decode-latency math for a ~50-word (~67-token) cleanup:** at ~118 tok/s decode + 0.3 s TTFT → ~0.3 + 0.57 ≈ **~0.87 s** for a 4B model producing full-length output. A 3B model (~115 tok/s, TTFT 0.2 s) → ~0.78 s. **So the raw model call exceeds the 300–500ms budget for full-length output** — mitigations in §7 (resident model, streaming+incremental insert, shorter output, speculative decoding) are load-bearing, not optional. INFERRED from OBSERVED throughput.

## 3. Serving runtime: Ollama vs llama.cpp server vs MLX (mlx-lm) on M4 Pro 24 GB

| Dimension | **MLX / mlx-lm** | **llama.cpp (llama-server)** | **Ollama** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decode tok/s (small models, M-series) | **Fastest.** ~1.4–1.8× raw llama.cpp on dense; up to 3× on MoE. ~230 tok/s vs ~150 short-context in one bench. OBSERVED (yage.ai, arxiv 2511.05502) | Baseline; strong. Raw llama.cpp ~89 tok/s where Ollama got 43 on same MoE. OBSERVED | **Slowest**: Go wrapper layer "consumes ~50% of performance" vs raw llama.cpp. 43 vs 89 tok/s same model. OBSERVED (yage.ai) |
| Prefill / TTFT | Slightly **worse** at prefill than llama.cpp; ~50% slower TG at 30K+ context. Fine for our short prompts. OBSERVED | **Best prefill** / prompt processing; Flash-Attention. OBSERVED | Inherits llama.cpp backend on M4 Pro (see next row) |
| **⚠️ Ollama MLX backend** | native | native (this is the C++ engine) | **Ollama's MLX backend (v0.19, 2026-03-30) requires >32 GB unified memory AND M5-class neural accelerators — it will NOT activate on a 24 GB M4 Pro.** On our target Ollama silently uses its **llama.cpp** backend (the slow-wrapper path). OBSERVED (ollama.com/blog/mlx) — **this kills Ollama as the "fast" option on the target machine.** |
| Structured output / JSON | Via **Outlines** (schema→regex→FSM token mask) or `mlx_lm.server` `response_format`/`json_schema` (OpenAI-style). OBSERVED (dottxt Outlines; ml-explore/mlx-lm SERVER.md) | **GBNF grammars** (native); ships `json.gbnf` + `json_schema_to_grammar.py`; `response_format: {json_object|json_schema}` on `/v1/chat/completions` (known bug: can't pass json_schema+grammar together). Grammar masking is **CPU-bound, not parallelized → adds latency**. OBSERVED (ggml-org server README; issue #11847) | `format: "json"` or full JSON-schema (v0.5+), implemented **on top of** llama.cpp GBNF; does **not** validate the full response against the schema. OBSERVED (danielclayton blog) |
| Keep model resident in RAM | Persistent process (`mlx_lm.server` / mlx-openai-server FastAPI) holds weights in unified memory for process lifetime. | `llama-server` holds weights for process lifetime; explicit `--mlock`. | `keep_alive`: default **5 min**, set `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` or per-request `keep_alive:-1` to **pin permanently**, `0` to unload immediately. OBSERVED (Ollama FAQ) |
| First-run / bundling UX | **Hardest to bundle cleanly** (Python + mlx deps), but best perf & pure-Apple. Can embed via a pinned venv or the Swift `mlx-swift` bindings for a native app. | **Best for bundling a native app**: single C++ binary, no Python, link `libllama`/`libmlx`? no — link libllama; ship the GGUF; embeddable in-process (no server needed). | **Best turnkey install UX** but heavyweight: separate daemon, its own model store, background service; and no MLX speedup on 24 GB. |
| OpenAI-compatible HTTP | `mlx_lm.server` / mlx-openai-server (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `client.responses.parse()` w/ Pydantic) | `llama-server` `/v1/chat/completions` (SSE streaming) | `/v1/chat/completions` + native `/api/chat` |

**Recommendation for WhimprFlow (native macOS app, 24 GB, best latency + clean bundling):**
1. **Primary: embed `llama.cpp` in-process** (link `libllama`, ship the Qwen3-4B Q4_K_M GGUF). Best prefill/TTFT, single native binary, no Python, no daemon, trivial `--mlock`/resident weights, GBNF for optional structured output. This is the most controllable path for hitting the latency budget and the cleanest to ship.
2. **Optional fast path: MLX** via `mlx-swift` (native Swift, no Python) for users who want the ~1.4–1.8× decode edge — but MLX's win is largest on longer generations/MoE; for ~67-token cleanup outputs the difference vs llama.cpp is small and llama.cpp's better prefill partly offsets it.
3. **Do NOT depend on Ollama** for the default local path: its MLX backend won't engage on the 24 GB M4 Pro, leaving the slow Go-wrapper llama.cpp path, plus a heavyweight daemon and separate model store. Ollama is fine only as an "advanced users, bring-your-own-server" option behind a custom-endpoint setting.

**Structured output guidance for cleanup:** default to **plain-text output** with a tight system prompt — it is the lowest-latency option (grammar/FSM masking is CPU-bound and adds ms). Reserve JSON-schema constraint only if you need structured metadata (e.g. `{text, applied_vocab[]}`); if so, GBNF (llama.cpp) or Outlines (MLX) both work.

---

## 4. RAM co-residency in 24 GB (cleanup LLM + ASR resident together)

- Qwen3-4B Q4 ≈ **2.5 GB** weights + ~1 GB per 8K context (we need <1K ctx) → **~3 GB resident**. OBSERVED (willitrunai/localai; Qwen3.5-35B ctx-scaling figure).
- Local ASR (cross-track, rough): Whisper large-v3 ≈ 1.5–3 GB, distil/Parakeet smaller. Budget ~2–3 GB.
- Combined ~5–6 GB, leaving ~18 GB for macOS + apps on a 24 GB machine → **both models stay resident comfortably**; no swapping. Keep both pinned (`--mlock` / `keep_alive:-1`) so neither reloads between dictations. INFERRED from OBSERVED sizes. This is the single biggest latency win locally (avoids cold-load on each dictation).

---

## 5. Claude API side (cross-checked against docs.claude.com, 2026-07)

**Model choice: Claude Haiku 4.5** — the correct pick for a low-latency ~50-word cleanup call (the spec's "Haiku-class"). Do **not** use Opus/Sonnet here despite skill defaults; the task is latency- and cost-sensitive, not intelligence-sensitive.

| Field | Value (OBSERVED, docs.claude.com models overview) |
|---|---|
| ID | `claude-haiku-4-5` (pinned snapshot `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) |
| Pricing | **$1.00 / MTok input, $5.00 / MTok output** |
| Context / max output | 200K in / 64K out |
| Latency class | **"Fastest"** of the lineup |
| Thinking | Extended thinking: Yes; adaptive: No → **for cleanup, do NOT enable thinking** (omit it; default off) to minimize latency |
| Structured outputs | Supported (use `output_config.format` json_schema if needed; plain text otherwise) |
| Streaming | Supported (SSE) — use it and insert incrementally |

**Prompt caching (OBSERVED, claude-api skill + prompt-caching doc):**
- Cache **read ≈ 0.1×** base input; **write = 1.25×** (5-min TTL) or **2×** (1-h TTL).
- **⚠️ Minimum cacheable prefix for Haiku 4.5 = 4096 tokens.** A typical cleanup system prompt + small user dictionary (~500–800 tokens) is **below the floor and will silently NOT cache** (`cache_creation_input_tokens: 0`). To benefit you must deliberately pad the static prefix past 4096 tokens (few-shot examples + full dictionary) — otherwise skip caching. For our small payloads, **caching is primarily a latency lever (skips prefill), not a cost lever**, and the write premium can exceed savings for bursty single-shot dictations.

**Per-dictation cost estimate (~50 words ≈ 67 output tokens; assume ~800-token static prefix + 67-token transcript):**
- **No caching:** input 867 tok × $1/1M = $0.00087; output 67 tok × $5/1M = $0.00034 → **≈ $0.0012 / dictation** (~$1.20 per 1,000). A heavy user at 100 dictations/day ≈ **$0.12/day ≈ $3.6/month**. Effectively negligible. INFERRED (arithmetic on OBSERVED prices).
- **With a ≥4096-token cached prefix:** cache-read 4096 × $0.10/1M = $0.00041 + fresh 67 in × $1/1M + 67 out × $5/1M ≈ **$0.00082 / dictation**, plus a ~$0.005 cache-write each time the 5-min window lapses. Only wins for sustained rapid dictation.

**Latency estimate (Claude path):** Haiku prefill of <900 tokens is trivial server-side; end-to-end is dominated by **network RTT + TTFT**. Realistic **p50 ≈ 400–800ms** for the cleanup call (streaming first token typically ~300–500ms + short decode of ~67 tokens). Baseten hit **<700ms p99 for the *entire* ASR+LLM+network pipeline** only with dedicated TensorRT infra + regional placement — a generic Anthropic API call over the public internet won't beat that, so the **strict 300–500ms p50 is more reliably met by the local path**; the Claude path is best-effort within ~500–800ms. INFERRED from OBSERVED (Haiku "fastest"; Baseten 700ms p99).

---

## 6. Provider-abstraction design (single settings toggle: local ↔ Claude)

**Interface (language-agnostic; implement in Swift/Rust/whatever the app core is):**
```
protocol CleanupProvider {
    // Streams cleaned text tokens; caller inserts incrementally.
    func cleanup(rawTranscript: String,
                 context: CleanupContext) -> AsyncStream<String>
    func healthCheck() async -> HealthStatus   // .ready / .degraded / .down
    func warmup() async                        // load/resident + prefill static prefix
}
struct CleanupContext {
    let userDictionary: [VocabEntry]   // auto-learned terms + corrections
    let appContext: String?            // frontmost app / field hint
    let styleProfile: String?          // learned user style
    let systemPrompt: String           // static; identical across both providers
}
enum CleanupMode { case local, claude }   // the single settings toggle
```
- **LocalCleanupProvider**: talks to in-process `llama.cpp` (or a localhost OpenAI-compatible endpoint from `llama-server`/`mlx_lm.server`). Model pinned resident.
- **ClaudeCleanupProvider**: Anthropic SDK, `claude-haiku-4-5`, `stream=True`, thinking off, optional prompt caching on the static prefix.
- Both share the **same system prompt + dictionary formatting** so behavior is consistent and the toggle is truly drop-in.

**Timeout + fallback-to-raw-transcript (the safety net Wispr implies but we must build):**
- Hard per-call **deadline ~1200–1500ms** (a bit above worst-case local decode). On timeout, error, refusal (Claude `stop_reason:"refusal"`), health=down, or empty output → **insert the raw ASR transcript verbatim** so the user is *never blocked*. Cleanup is an enhancement, never a gate.
- Stream-and-commit: begin inserting cleaned tokens as they arrive; if the stream stalls past a **first-token deadline (~600ms)**, abandon and paste raw. Never leave the caret hanging.
- Log fallback events to feed a "cleanup reliability" health metric and (optionally) auto-suggest switching modes.

**Health checks:**
- **Local:** on launch + on mode-switch, `warmup()` loads the model into unified memory and runs a 1-token prefill of the static prefix; `healthCheck()` = process alive + a sub-50ms echo probe. Degraded if load not finished.
- **Claude:** `healthCheck()` = API key present + a cheap reachability signal (cached 200 from a lightweight `models.retrieve` or a prior success within N sec). Treat 401/403 (bad/absent key) as **.down → auto-fall back to local** if a local model is installed, else raw transcript. Handle 429/5xx with one fast retry then raw-transcript fallback (don't burn the latency budget on backoff).

**First-run / bundling UX:**
- Ship the app **without** the model weights; on first launch (or first local-mode use), download the Qwen3-4B Q4 GGUF (~2.5 GB) with a progress UI and checksum verify. Until it's present, default to Claude mode (if key set) or a "download to enable local" prompt. This keeps the installer small and mirrors how Ollama/LM Studio onboard, but inside our own UI.
- Claude mode requires only an API key paste (no download) → good zero-friction fallback while the local model downloads.

## 7. Hitting ~300–500ms p50 added cleanup latency in BOTH modes

The LLM stage is the lever (ASR is a separate track). Tactics, in priority order:

**Local mode:**
1. **Keep the model resident & pre-warmed** (`--mlock` / `keep_alive:-1`; MLX/llama.cpp persistent process). Eliminates per-dictation cold-load (which alone can be 0.5–2s). OBSERVED (Ollama keep_alive).
2. **Prefill the static prefix on Fn-key-down**, before the user finishes speaking — so when the transcript lands, only the ~67 transcript tokens + output remain. Overlaps LLM prefill with speaking.
3. **Stream + insert incrementally.** Perceived latency ≈ TTFT (~0.2–0.3s), not full decode (~0.6–0.9s). This is how you *feel* sub-500ms even when total decode is ~0.8s.
4. **Cap output length** (cleanup output ≈ input length; set `max_tokens` tightly, e.g. input_tokens×1.3) to bound decode.
5. **Prefer the smaller model (Llama-3.2-3B / SmolLM3-3B, ~115 tok/s, TTFT 0.2s)** for the latency-sensitive toggle; Qwen3-4B for quality.
6. **Speculative/draft decoding** (0.5B draft + 4B target) via llama.cpp `--model-draft` — meaningful decode speedup for the predictable, low-entropy cleanup task. INFERRED (standard llama.cpp feature; well-suited to editing).
7. Use **plain-text output** (no grammar masking) to avoid CPU-bound token-mask latency.

**Claude mode:**
1. **Stream** and insert incrementally (perceived latency = TTFT ~0.3–0.5s).
2. **Keep an HTTP/2 connection warm** (avoid TLS/connection setup per dictation).
3. **Prompt-cache the static prefix** *only if* you pad it ≥4096 tokens (Haiku floor) — cuts server prefill; otherwise the small prefill is already fast and caching adds no value.
4. **No thinking**, tight `max_tokens`, Haiku 4.5 (fastest tier).
5. Network RTT is the irreducible floor — realistic p50 ~400–800ms; the strict 300–500ms is best-effort here, which is exactly why local is the default.

**Net:** local mode can hit ~300–500ms *perceived* p50 (streaming + resident + prewarm), and ~600–900ms for full committed output on a 4B model. Claude mode is ~400–800ms p50, network-bound. Both must fall back to raw transcript on breach so the budget is a soft UX target, never a hard block.

## Open items flagged
- Exact Wispr cleanup model size/variant is undisclosed ("Llama," controllable/customizable) — we infer a small fine-tuned Llama (3B/8B class); our clone uses Qwen3-4B/Llama-3.2-3B.
- Environment contains newer/possibly-synthetic models (Qwen3.5/3.6, Gemma 4, M5, Ollama 0.19, Claude Fable 5) beyond the Jan-2026 knowledge cutoff; recommendations are anchored on confirmed real models (Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, Gemma-3-4B QAT, Phi-4-mini, Llama-3.2-3B, Haiku 4.5). If Qwen3.5-4B / a 24GB-capable Ollama MLX build actually ship on the target, revisit §3.
- Per-4B-model TTFT/tok/s figures come from benchmark-aggregator blogs (±20%); validate on the actual M4 Pro 24 GB unit before finalizing the latency budget.


## Open questions
- Exact model/size of Wispr Flow's Llama cleanup model is undisclosed — our clone must pick (Qwen3-4B vs Llama-3.2-3B) empirically
- Some models surfaced (Qwen3.5/3.6, Gemma 4, M5 chips, Ollama 0.19 MLX, Claude Fable 5) are beyond the Jan-2026 knowledge cutoff and may be synthetic/future; recommendations anchored on confirmed real models — re-verify availability on the target machine
- Per-model TTFT/tok-s numbers are from benchmark-aggregator blogs (±20%); need validation on the actual M4 Pro 24GB unit
- Whether a ≥4096-token padded prefix (to enable Haiku prompt caching) is worth the write premium depends on real dictation burst patterns — measure
- Speculative-decoding speedup for the cleanup task on M4 Pro is inferred, not measured — benchmark 0.5B-draft + 4B-target
