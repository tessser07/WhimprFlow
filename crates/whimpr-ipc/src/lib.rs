//! `whimpr-ipc` — the shared wire contract between the WhimprFlow Tauri shell and
//! the native sidecar process that owns the global hotkey hook, text injection,
//! secure-input detection, and the accessibility/UI-Automation context read.
//!
//! The hook lives out-of-process so that saturating on-device inference (ASR + LLM)
//! in the main process can never starve the low-level keyboard callback past the
//! OS timeout — on Windows that removal is silent and unrecoverable, so isolation
//! plus a heartbeat/respawn (see [`SidecarToShell::Heartbeat`]) is the whole point.
//!
//! Because both ends are Rust, these enums are the single source of truth for the
//! protocol — there is no code generation step.
